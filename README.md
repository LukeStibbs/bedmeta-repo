Physics formulas:    
d = total distance traveled    
  
D(displacement) = (final position) - (initial position)    
or absolute distance from zero    
  
Displacement is a vector quantity    
is has magnitude and direction    
e.x. 300km North  

Distance is a Scaler quantity    
It only has magnitude  
e.x. 250mi    

 Speed
-------  
How fast something is moving  
d = Vt  
distance = speed * time  
displacement = velocity * time  
acceleration = how fast the velocity is changing  

a = (change in velocity) / (change in time)   
a = (Vf - Vo) / t  

Vf = Vo + at  
Speed = |v|  

g = -9.8m/s^2  
-Gravity on Earth  

Projectile motion  
-----------------   
Trajectory is the path that the object travels  
 
 Vx = vcos(theta)  
 Vy = vsin(theta)
